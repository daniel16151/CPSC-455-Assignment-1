Before we start the documentation, once again we have to say that we got help/assists from chatgpt and gemini ai, thank you.

As we start our capstone, we started browsing through multiple services first, alongside the fact that we set up the basics from there, ranging from free cloud storage
to making MySQL databases to get us started.

Afterwards, we started converting our code from being a separate chat application to being fully function as a webpage, which was successful, but with adjustments
that were occurring, all that changed are how the code adjustments are going to work now, with different files being the main files to focus on now, rather than
client.py. Even though server.py can still be adjusted, the client files are now required to be adjusted via index.html and chat.js. These are meant to replace the
server.py completely, mainly because the chat application has been converted into a website rather than what it used to be. 

Once that was done, we got to work immediately in terms of the other tasks that needed to be done, such as heartbeat mechanisms. Since we weren't really sure yet
in terms of testing, we chose to branch off of the main branch and have 2 pull requests to see if it looks good or not. We'll just see how that goes.
