day 1:
- started setting up MySQL backend on InfinityFree alongside MySQL databases.
- implemented a brand new changelog and documentation for the capstone.
- implemented databases that stores user information, messages, and logs.
- started setting up firebase storage for file sharing, which will be useful later on within the project.

day 2:
- converted the chat application to an actual website with the subdomain aquired. 
- instead of client.py, index.html and chat.js are the main files that are needed to be adjusted now
- server.py remains the same, and adjustments are still required for that python file.

day 3:
- asked AI for help in terms of how I can implement a heartbeat/ping mechanism, hopefully completing task 2 or at least almost fully completed
- branched off of the main code just to be cautious
- made 2 pull requests, awaiting for other group member to confirm if that it works or not.

day 4:
- implemented online/offline presence and was improvised even more with AI in terms of how to make it more smoother
- branched off once again just to be safe
- merged the pull request to form into one branch, and merged again to main after knowing that the heartbeat mechanism works according to the other group member
- made another pull request and branch, alongside the fact that it happens to be the online/offline presence implementation
