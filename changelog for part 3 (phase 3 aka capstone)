day 1:
- started setting up MySQL backend on InfinityFree alongside MySQL databases.
- implemented a brand new changelog and documentation for the capstone.
- implemented databases that stores user information, messages, and logs.
- started setting up firebase storage for file sharing, which will be useful later on within the project.

day 2:
- converted the chat application to an actual website with the subdomain aquired. 
- instead of client.py, index.html and chat.js are the main files that are needed to be adjusted now
- server.py remains the same, and adjustments are still required for that python file.
