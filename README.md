# CPSC-455-ASSIGNMENT-1
Instructions:
Install python and websockets on two systems.
Once they are installed, run server.py on one system, and wait until "Websocket server started on ws://127.0.0.1:7890" has popped up. 
Once that has popped up, run client.py to join the server on the first system.
Run client.py on the second system and enter your user input on either client to communicate with the other.
(For the URI, make sure to set [127.0.0.1] to the local IP of the host system. This can be found by entering ipconfig into cmd prompt in host system.)
